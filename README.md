HTTP defines a set of request
methods
HTTP action /URL Meaning
GET /things -> Retrieve list of things
GET /things/23 -> Retrieve one thing identified with

23

POST /things -> Create a new thing
PUT /things/23 -> Replace thing 23 (or create thing

23)*
DELETE /things/23 -> Delete thing 23

GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.
Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
POST
The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource,
often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target
resource with the request payload.
DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
