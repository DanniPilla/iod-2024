//1. What are the results of these expressions? (answer first, then use console.log() to check)

console.log("" + 1 + 0 ) //will display 10 string concatenation
console.log("" - 1 + 0) //will display -1
console.log (true + false) // display 1. true converts to 1 and false to 0
console.log(!true)// display false
console.log(6 / "3") //2
console.log ("2" * "3")//6
4 + 5 + "px" //9px
"$" + 4 + 5 //$45
"4" - 2 //2 
"4px" - 2 //nan
" -9 " + 5 //-95
" -9 " - 5 //nan
null + 1 // 1
undefined + 1 //nan
undefined == null // true
undefined === null //false
" \t \n" - 2 //I really dunno

// Which of the below are not giving the right answer? Why are they not correct? How can we
// fix them?
let three = "3"
let four = "4"
let thirty = "30"
//what is the value of the following expressions?
let addition = three + four //34. To get 7 we can do let addition = number(three) + number(four);
let multiplication = three * four //12
let division = three / four //0.75
let subtraction = three - four //-1
let lessThan1 = three < four //true
let lessThan2 = thirty < four //false


// Which of the following console.log messages will print? Why?
if (0) console.log('#1 zero is true') // 0 is considered false
if ("0") console.log('#2 zero is true') // string values are considered true?
if (null) console.log('null is true') //No. Null is false
if (-1) console.log('negative is true') //yes. All non 0 numbers are true???
if (1) console.log('positive is true') //yes same as above
